Abstract:
Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is critical for healthcare monitoring, but centralized data aggregation poses privacy risks. We propose FGCLE‑HAR, a federated graph contrastive learning framework augmented with XAI modules to capture spatial–temporal dependencies and generate saliency maps for model transparency. Experiments on MHealth, PAMAP2, and TNDA datasets show 92.5% accuracy (↑6.7% vs. FedAvg) and 20% fewer communication rounds, demonstrating efficiency and interpretability in privacy‑sensitive scenarios.

In accordance with MDPI’s reviewer guidelines, please declare any potential conflicts of interest (e.g., past collaborations or shared affiliations) before accepting
